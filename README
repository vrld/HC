General Purpose 2D Collision Detection System

Documentation and examples here:
http://vrld.github.com/HardonCollider

I was using Hardon in some small personal projects, 
and I wanted a global raycast (instead of only being able to check if a given shape intersects a ray)
so I though I would try to implement it.
